	  I am a research scientist at <a href="https://en.horizon.ai/gail">General AI Lab</a>,
	  <a href="http://en.horizon.ai">Horizon Robotics</a>.
	  I got my Bachelor of Computer Science from Peking University,
    and my Ph.D. of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)
	  from Purdue University. Previously, I worked at <a href="https://usa.baidu.com/">
    Baidu Research</a> and <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/">Facebook AI Research</a>.

  <p>My earlier research topics include object segmentation <small>[ACMMM2010]</small>,
    language grounding from video <small>[ACL2013,AAAI2015,JAIR2015,IJCV2017]</small>, video captioning
    <small>[CVPR2016]</small>, embodied AI <small>[ICLR2018,CoRL2018,arXiv2019]</small>,
    and the lottery ticket hypothesis <small>[NeurIPS2019,ICLR2020]</small>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since joining Horizon Robotics in 2019, I've been working on reinforcement
    learning (RL) problems, including hierarchical RL <small>[ICLR2021,NeurIPS2021]</small>,
    safe/constrained RL, and exploration. I am also an active maintainer of the RL framework

    <h4>Research interests</h4>
    <div><p>
      After working on various topics of AI using deep learning, now as a researcher I'm no longer
      satisfied with applying deep learning, as a blackbox optimization tool, to a fixed dataset
      (no matter how large it is), for the sole purpose of learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation">
      statistical correlations</a> \(f(x,y)\). For instance, \((x,y)\)
      could be \((image,label)\), \((video,sentence)\), \((sentence, sentence)\), or any other such
      combinations.
      <p>

      <p>
      I personally don't believe that correlation will lead us to true AI, just as we
      "don't get to the moon by climbing a tree". Studying how to get to the tree top isn't
      that really exciting to me. Deep learning has already proven its
      strong capability of learning really complex correlations, and it might be better to leave
      correlation learning tasks at scale to product teams in the industry, in specific application scenarios.
      <!--(This isn't saying that deep learning as
      a powerful tool shouldn't be studied by researchers any more; in fact more basic research on how
      it works or how to further improve it in general is needed.)-->
      </p>

      <p>
        So far, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_reasoning">causal reasoning</a>
        is a promising direction to strong AI, or at least it is a further step towards it
        compared to correlation learning. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">
          Reinforcement learning</a> can be thought of having a little
        flavor of causal reasoning because it usually asks one question: what consequences will
        I get if I take this action under this context (\(Q(s,a)\))? RL also gives an agent
        the opportunity of interacting with its surrounding environment to acquire embodied
        knowledge, which I think is critical to strong AI.
